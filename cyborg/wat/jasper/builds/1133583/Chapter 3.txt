Point of View

-Charlotte Dy-

 

 

3 years passed. The moments when I'm being bullied flashed back in my mind. I still remember those days, and I will never ever forget those. Especaially the people who thought me how to be strong, the people that bullied me.

 

 

"Hey! I got this first!" there she is.

"I don't care! I saw this first, so hand it over." Ms. Oh-so-zombie-fac

"No! This is mine!"

 

Ugh. They're so irritating! -_______-

 

"Hand it to her, bitch." i said coldly to Ms. Oh-so-zombie-face

"Who are you? And how dare you call me bitch!"

"If you don't give that to her, you're a fvckng bitch. Will 'ya?" Ms. Oh-so-zombie-face handed the dress to her. I can see that her face is turning red because of anger. Psh. Serves her right -____-

 

"And you." I looked at Natasha. "Pay that, now."

 

I just glared at her. That's Natasha Atkinson, my British friend. You heard it right. I thought I would never get a friend. But she's so childish. It almost took her 3 months just so we can be friends. The day we became friends was when she climbed up my window just to give pizzas 'cause it's her birthday. I found it crazy, but it shows how true she is to me.


I waited for her until she paid that fvckng dress. She's so damn shoppaholic. She almost spent 4 hours buying this and that. She buys everything she see. Ugh. While here I am, following her. I can't leave her alone shopping. She's been good to me the past years so let me be good to her. She's my friend. Best friend.

 

"Natasha, can we go home now?" I asked her with my cold voice.

"Nah. Let's eat first. Ice cream? My treat!" She smiled. She knows what my weakness is -___-

"That's why you're getting fat. Ugh. Hurry up."

 

We entered the ice cream parlor that have my favorite flavor of ice cream. Natasha ordered for me while I find our seats. I found one beside the window. The chairs are comfortable, so it's fine with me. Natasha arrived at the table with my ice cream. She sat infront of me. I took the spoon and eat like I didn't eat for a month.

 

"Hey, slowly, Charlotte. You're gonna have indigestion." Natasha said.

"Natasha, this is ice cream. It melts in my mouth, I can't have indigestion with this." 
I said to her as I entered the spoon full of ice cream on my mouth.

"Alright, alright. But.. Are you really moving back to the Philippines? I mean, you're leaving me here? ALONE?!" she shouted.

 

"Don't shout. You can come if you like." 

"Really, I can?! I would love to! When is your flight?" Now sheshouted with happiness. Oh god. She's so bipolar!

"Psh. You only like to come with me because you want to go to the malls and buy all their stuff." the ice cream melted in my mouth. Ugh, this will be the last time I'll eat this ice cream.

 

"Well, you're right 'bout that. But aside from that, I want to be with you! You know I'm all alone with myself.." she flashed a sad face.

 

Natasha lived by all herself for 2 years. Her parents died on a car accident. I was her only friend by that time. So, I became a sister to her, just so she wouldn't be sad. "Drop the topic, Natasha. Don't bring it up, you'll just cry again and I'll have to comfort you. Just eat your ice cream, so I can prepare my things. Tomorrow is my flight." I said coldly. I don't want her to be sad again so I allowed her to come with me in the Philippines.

 

She smiled weakly, "Thanks, Charlotte. I owe you big time." she ate her ice cream.

 

I looked at her. She's just a silly girl who doesn't have any friends aside from me. She only have me.And i'd be willing to be with her forever. Though my attittude is not like hers: jolly, loud, crazy, talkative and shoppalic -- I still appreciate her. It's not just me who needs a friend, she also needs one. And I'm here for her.

 

I drove back to my condominium after dropping Natasha to her house. I already packed some of my things last night, but I still have some to pack. Tomorrow, is the start. The start of something new. I'm coming back, the nerd is gonna come back. But not with a face of a nerd. But with a face of a cold bitch that was humiliated.
