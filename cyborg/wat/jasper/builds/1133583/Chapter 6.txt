Point of View

-Charlotte Dy-

 

 

 

 

"I'm not blind to see you, Hannah."


Tumingin siya saken. Tss. The same Hannah I know 3 years ago..

 

"Sino ka ba?!"  galit na galit siya. Her face is red. Tumayo na din siya.

"Aw.. Nakalimutan mo na ako agad?"


Tumingn siya sakin ng naguguluhan.. Tsk. Slowpoke. Pagong na babae -_____________-

 

"Slowpoke. Fine, hindi mo ko naaalala? Psh. Charlotte Dy, remember?"

 

Lumaki naman yung mata niya. Gosh. I'm loving this.

 

"Cha-Charlotte?"

"Gusto mo paulit-ulit? You're so dumb." I said to her coldly. Naeexcite nako sa mangyayari samin. HA! >:) "Mukha namang ikaw na yung tanga satin. I won't waste my precious time to you."

 

Nilagpasan ko siya. Tulala pa rin siya at gulat. Sumunod naman sakin si Natasha. Psh. Kasama ko nga pala 'tong babaeng 'to -________________-

 

"You're so cool, Charlotte! By the way, who's the girl?" Tanong sakin ni Natasha. Nasa parking lot na kame ngayon

"Hannah." Ge, ako na tamad magsalita. -________-

"Hannah..? Oh! I remember you throwing that dart things at at her picture that's pinned on the dart board." Ugh. Umiiral nanaman pag ka makulit niya -_________-

 

"Let's just eat. I'm fvcking hungry."

 

Pinaandar ko na yung kotse ko. Kung di ko pa tatapusin yung usapan namin ni Natasha, it will lead us to nothing. -______-

Pumunta kame sa mall. Pagkaparada ko ng kotse ko, napatingin ako kay Natasha sa passenger's seat. Ang putla niya..?

 

"What happened to you?" Tanong ko sa kanya.

"A-am I-I s-still a-a-a-alive?"

"Why, you wanna die? Ofcourse you are." Sinabi ko yun ng may sarcasm. Ano nanaman problema neto?

"Ch-cha-Charlotte.. The way you d-d-drive, seems like I'm gonna d-d-die.." Tsk. Ngayon ko nga lang pala nakasabay ko sa kotse. Di niya alam, mabilis talaga ako magdrive. Baket ba? Feel ko lang na nakikipag-car racing ko? Psh. -_____________-

"Tsh. Whatever. Let's go. I'm starving." Bumaba na ko sa kotse. Napatingin naman sakin yung mga lalake na nakatayo sa tabi ng kotse nila. Ugh. Ngayon lang ba sila nakakita ng babaeng nagdadrive ng bagong labas na kotse? -______________-

 

 

Pumasok kame sa mall. Unang-una kong pinuntahan, syempre! Sa McDo. Bata na kung bata, I like it here. Tumawa, bubugbugin ko. Y_______________Y

 

"Charlotte, isn't this place for kids?" -_____________-"

"Natasha, just shut your mouth, okay? Find a seat, I'll order."

Point of view

-Natasha Atkinson-

 

 

"Natasha, just shut your mouth, okay? Find a seat, I'll order." 

"O-okay." 


 

I took the seat beside the human-size figure of McDonald's. I remember Charlotte being angry because she's hungry. Yeah, that's her. She arrived at the table with lots of fries at the tray. Oh gosh. Did I tell you guys that this girl loves fries? She ordered 15 large fries. -__________-'

 

"You're really that hungry eh, Charlotte?" I said to her sarcasticly.

"Just eat." I got a  hand- full of fries and ate it. Wonder why she eats plenty of fries, yet her legs is still in shape. 'Cause I hear that by eating fries, legs can become big.

 
I reached out for fries. I noticed that the boys beside our table is looking at us. "Charlotte, do you know them? They've been looking at us since we arrived here." She looked at those people. I can tell that her expression is like: (-____________-")

 

She looked at me. "Don't mind them." Then she eat again. Charlotte's really cold.

 

We finished eating so we roam around the mall. Charlotte told me that this mall is her family's. They're so rich. I SWEAR!

After we eat, we shopped 'till we drop. LOL. Love that line! ^_______________^

 

But, seriously, I'm the only one shopping. You know guys, shopping is my hobby. Charlotte here said she's at the Timezone if she needs me. That girl, never loves shopping -______________-

After buying all the good clothes I see, I texted Charlotte. I'm so tired -_____-

 

From: Charlotte <3
Come here. I'm still playing.

 


Ugh, great. Did I tell you guys that she's freakin' lazy? It's like.. I'm at the Annex then she's at the other building. And that's too far away!I have paper bags in my hand. -___________-

 

I was walking when a cab, not a cab like taxi's, stopped beside me. It's a cab where you can sit down and accompany you to your destination.

 

"Hi, Miss! Going somewhere?" It was boy. A handsome guy. Oh gosh *O*

"Uhh.. Ye-yeah." OMG. Why am I stuttering?!

"Oh.. Would you like to take a cab? I'll accompany you there." He smiled. Seriously, He's freakin' H-A-N-D-S-O-M-E.

"Uhh, su-sure.." Ugh. Stop stuttering! He helped me with the paper bags and to get on.

"So, where is the beautiful lady beside me going?" He smiled smiling. OMG!!

"A-at the T-Timezone.." 

"Ok. By the way, I'm Nathan." He reached out his right hand while his left hand on the steering wheel.

"I'm Natasha.. Nice to meet you." A smile flashed on my lips! OMY! >////////////////////<

"Oh.. Destiny must have played with us.. Imagine, our names. Hahaha!"

"Uhh.. Yeah.. Hahaha." I laughed. Maybe, destiny is really unpredictable.

 

I can say that he's a British, also. But he's also a Filipino. He concentrated on driving the cab while I secretly look at him. My heart went thumping, beating faster. Can this be.... love?

 

"Natasha, we're here." 

 

I looked around, yeah right. At the timezone. He helped me to get down and reached for my paper bags. And said farewell to each other. But the last words he said made my heart beat so fast:

 

"I'll see you again, Miss Gorgeous." Which resulted me to bump on the glass door of Timezone. -__________-

"Natasha, you look like an idiot." Charlotte snapped me back to reality. "You really look like an idiot, smiling out of nowhere." 

"I met my destiny...." I said to her. But she just looked at me with disgust. Right, Charlotte's a man-hater. -____- She walked past me, I just followed her.

 

Now, I'm walking like an idiot. This smile can't get out of my lips. Oh.. How I really wish that we can meet again. I guess, I found my destiny..
