Point of View

-Natasha Atkinson-

 

 

 

Hey there! Did Charlotte introduced me to you guys? Well, if yes. GREAT! If not, but I think she already introduced me, I'll still introduce myself..

 

I'm Natasha Collie Atkinson. Everybody calls me Natasha. Supposedly they do, because Charlotte is the only friend I have. Even Charlotte simply calls me 'Natasha', but sometimes 'Ash'. It's cool, anyway. I'm 18 years old, born in England. I accompanied Charlotte here in the Philippines 'cause I know she doesn't have any friends here. She once told me that she used to have one friend when she was in high school. But that friend of hers betrayed her, as Charlotte said.

 

Charlotte had been my best friend. She's always there for me when I'm in trouble. Like what happened in the mall before we fled to the Philippines. She was like my Princess-in-shining-armor. Yeah, 'Princess'. She's a girl. >:) But aside from being my best friend, she also treats me as her OWN sister. Yes, she's cold. Everything she do is frightening. But I did whatever I can do so that she can be my friend. When we was in States, they we're newly moved in to the house next to mine. She was so quiet. When I look at her, it always give me the creeps. She's scary when she looks at you. I know that she needs a friend to lean on. I see her everyday by herself. I approached her and asked if we could be friends. She refused. But I didn't lose hope. I still irritate her. But later on, we became friends because of a pizza. Hahaha. Weird right?

 

I tell you guys, Charlotte is not that bad. She's just cold. She maybe fierce, heartless and scary on the outside. But deep inside, she's so nice and caring. She understands people around her. She never lets anyone beaten up, though sometimes she beats someone. She only beat someone for some reason. She may not tell it and hide it all to herself. But, believe me, she always have a reason.

 

By the way, today we'll go to JD University. It's a school, OBVIOUSLY. Charlotte said she wants to continue her studies. But she's already in 4th year college, why bother study if she have her mother's bussiness? Not my problem. But, the thing is..

 

"Charlotte! I have I favor to ask.." I shouted to her. She was at her room. I was outside.

"What is it?!" Though she yellled, there's still coldness in her voice.

"Can you also enroll me to that University?!"

"...." she didn't answered.

 

It's been minutes since she didn't answered. I stood frozen outside her room, my ears stuck to the door. Listening what's she doing inside..

 

"OUCH!"

"Tsk. Natasha, stalker much?" Her voice is soooo cold. She helped me stand up.

"Sorry. Anyway, about what I asked earlier.. Can you also enroll me to that Uni---" Bad girl. I'm talking then she suddenly puts her finger on my lips.

"Why would I ask you to come if I'm not enrolling you?" She crossed her arms. Oh god! I told you guys, SHE'S NICE!

"Really? I can also? Wooow. Thanks, Charlotte!" She walked past me.

"C'mon. Hurry up." I followed her up to the garage. Wow, this girl is really rich. Imagine, she have 8 cars and 2 big bikes in her garage. And her house is goddamn big. Ohnonono, her palace.

Point of view

-Charlotte Dy-

 

 

I entered my car to JDU. Matagal-tagal ko na rin 'to hindi nakita. Alot has changed. Pinarada ko yung Lamborghini Aventador J ko. Dumiretso kame ni Natasha sa Principal's Office. Pagkapasok na pagkapasok namin, nakasalubong ko si Hannah at Rachel. At first, di ko sila namukhaan. Their  face changed. Mukhang di naman nila ako namukhaan kaya dumaan nalang kame at dumiretso sa office.

 

"Charlotte? Is that you?" bungad sakin nung principal..

"Yes, Tita. It's me." Nagsmirk nalang ako.

 

Pamilya namin may ari ng JDU. John Dy University. Named after my Lolo. Mommy's supposed to be the principal of this school. But since fate played with her, Tita Veronica managed it. Marame kaming bussiness dito sa Pilipinas. I just chose to be quiet and not to show-off our wealth years ago. That's why I got humiliated.

 

"How have you been? Ang laki mo na.." 

 

Hindi ko siya sinagot. Alam ni Tita yung ugali ko. I ignored her question, "Tita, by the way.. This is Natasha Atkinson, my friend." 

"Ohh.. I can see that you're a British. I'm Veronica Dy, the principal of this school. And also Charlotte's Aunt." Nag smile si Tita V kay Natasha. Mabait naman si Tita V. Natasha smiled back.

"Uhh, Tita. Nagpunta po kame dito para magenroll." I said her coldly. Baka di pa ako makatapos ng pagaaral pag di ko pa sinabe. -______-

"Talaga? That's good! You too, Natasha?" Alam kong hindi naintindihan ni Natasha sinabi ni Tita kaya tumango nalang siya.

"Ok, just fill up this forms and you can go. Ako na bahala. Tomorrow will be the start of your classes." 

 

Finill-up -an namin yung form tapos lumabas na kame sa Principal's Office. Pinakiusapan ko si Tita V na wag pagsabi na pamangkin niya ako at kami ang may-ari ng school. Ayoko makarinig ng mga fcking chismis na yan sa school.

Tinour ko muna si Natasha sa school. Kahit na di ako nagsasalita at naglalakad lang habang siya naamaze at tinatanong nalang ako kung anong tawag sa ganun, tawag sa ganyan. Iba kase ang College sa States eh. Uggggggh

May nakabunggo saking babae. Kumalat yung mga dala niyang books at natumba. I looked at her. Psh. Sinuswerte ka nga naman..

 

"Hey! Bulag ka ba? Di mo ba nakitang nagmamadali ako tapos bubungguin mo pa ko?!"

 

 

"I'm not blind to see you, Hannah."
