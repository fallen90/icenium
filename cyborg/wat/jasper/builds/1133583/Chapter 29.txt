Point of View

-Natasha Atkinson-

 

 

From: Nathan <3

Let's meet later, I have something to tell you. ;-)

 

Isn't that exciting?! Seriously guys, me and Nathan have something already. It's not that we're already a couple. You know, getting-to-know-each-other. And I'm sooooooooooooo SAD 'cause we're still there. I mean, it's been.. months, I think, since we've met each other. I told him that I like him, he was... I don't know. But the other time, he also told me that he like me. That time, I almost collapsed. Swear to death.

 

I'm still here at Char's room. Think of that girl, she has two suitors yet she doesn't care? Having two suitors is my dream. But since I found Nathan, I think that dream is nothing no more. I already found a guy that I'll love forever and ever. As the teleserye say, "Walang Hanggan" or Infinite.

 

Alright, I suck at tagalog. I should learn how to speak some. It's not nice speaking English in a British way here in Philippines. I'm on the Philippines, not in UK.

 

I asked Char a while ago if we can go to the mall, she said yes the first time. But when her suitors came, she just left me alone. Oh well, It's great if it's just the two of us, Nathan and me, walking.. talking. Sounds great!

 

I got up and went to my room. Charlotte already left. That girl, I hope she chooses the one that her heart shouts for. On my opinion, I like Francis more than Yun Ju. But, Yun Ju's sweeter than Francis. Anyway, let's not get involved in their "love story". Let's get going on MY love story. Ok, ok. Whatever for me. Hahaha.

 

I took at bath and wore something nice. Sicne I don't know how to drive I just took a cab going to the mall. It's so confusing why'd we met at the mall, of all places. But, isn't it sweet? Ok, too much for the blushing.

 

Nathan texted me to meet at the Starbucks. While I walk, everyone was, like, looking or staring. Wonder why.. Before I took a seat, I ordered something, ofcourse. I forgot to eat lunch.

 

Nathan is almost, I think, an hour late. I keep texting him, but he's not texting back. Tried calling him, he's not picking up. I finished my food, he's not yet around. I look like a poor girl waiting for her daddy. I'm starting to get pissed!

 

"Excuse me, you're Natasha, right? Natasha Atkinson?" A guy that looks like Nathan, but absolutely NOT Nathan, approached me. Should I answer him? Char told me to don't talk to someone I don't know.

 

I just smiled at him. It's rude if I don't answer him. But I remembered what Char said so I just smiled at him. He took his phone from his pocket and called someone.

 

"Ne, hyung. Andito siya.. Eh?! Baka mapagkamalan pa kong kidnapper!... Alright, give me your credit card later as payment, arasso?... Hahaha, osige. San nga ulet?...  Ah, ok! Annyeong~" 

 

Ow--kay. He's speaking 3 languages. Tagalog, English and Korean. I envy him. I swear, I do. I'm dying to speak Tagalog. -_________- He returned his phone on his jeans' pocket and turned to me.

 

"Excuse me, mind if I take you somewhere?" 

 

I didn't answer back. He's words are creepy but his face isn't.

 

"Oh! Don't worry, I won't do something bad to you. I'd be killed, if so. So, let's go?" 

 

He's kinda nice. And looks nice. Maybe I should trust him. Alright, I got up from my seat. I followed him up to the rooftop. As soon as I entered the place, it was so dark. It's almost 8pm. The guy I was following was nowhere to be found. Where the heck is he? -_________-

 

I keep on walking. I stopped for awhile. I really can't see a thing. Ugh. Then moments later, the lights suddenly opened.

 

The whole place was fantastic! Rose petals everywhere. Music's starting to play. A mini stage at the end, where there are 3 guys singing. I saw the guy that accompanied me through here. I'm starting to get amazed of the place. What is this place?

 

"You liked it?" 

 

I heard a voice coming from behind me. I turned around and there I saw him.

 

"Nathan.."

"I'm sorry for being late. I was preparing this."

 

He looked around the place, me too. I looked at him, again. Tears began to fall from my eyes. I don't know why or how..

 

"Hey, stop crying. Didn't you liked it?" His voice was worried. He came near me then wiped those tears.

"I liked it.. Really do.." My voice was trembling. Maybe because I'm crying.

 

Nathan chuckled.He hugged me. I can feel my heart beating.. I can feel the time moving slow, thinking we're the only ones here in this place. It feels like time stopped.

 

He removed his arms wrapped around me, faced me then smiled. Please don't do that, I'm melting..

 

"Dance with me?" He offered his hand then he led me to the mini stage. Slow music started to play and the lights were dim. We stopped at the center then he held my waist. I wrapped my arms around his neck. We're dancing slow..

 

"I love you.." He whispered in my ear. Again, I can feel my tears running down on my cheeks. Those words were sweet.. I hugged him, but we're still slow dancing.

 

How I waited for a moment like this. It was like a fairytale. A magical tale that I'd never thought It would happen in real life. But it did. And it happened to me. Being loved by the one you like is like buying your favorite thing in it's lowest price. Love can do everything. Love is magic.

 

"I love you, too.." I faced him. We stared on each others eyes for a moment then magic happened.

 

I wanted to feel this magic. I thought I would just feel this when I get married. But I think I'm wrong. This magic was so great. We're kissing passionately.

 

If this is a dream, while I hope it's not, I wish it wouldn't end. I wish it would last longer. And I hope I woundn't wake up anymore.

 

Love conquers all. Even the simplest person on Earth can fall inlove. No one is exempted for love. Once you've been hit, you can't do nothing at all but to love him back. 'Cause it's magic that puts you together.

 

The guy infront of me is love. The thing between us.. is magic.
