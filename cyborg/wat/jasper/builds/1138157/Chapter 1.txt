When the BITTER GANGSTER fell inlove

PROLOGUE:

 

What do you expect from a BITTER GANGSTER like me.

 

 

I hate the word LOVE

 

 

For me....

 

 

IT DOESN'T EXIST.







But this word DOES EXIST







when it COMES FROM MY FAMILY... FRIENDS.







A BITTER GANGSTER like me should be STRONG







Enough to face these two F*CKING ASS*OL* 







who ruined my LIFE.







These TWO F*CKIN* SH*TS who break my heart







But..







until i've met this GANGSTER







who CHANGED me.










And.. change










THE BITTER GANGSTER'S PERSPECTIVE..










ABOUT THIS WORD







L.O.V.E.
