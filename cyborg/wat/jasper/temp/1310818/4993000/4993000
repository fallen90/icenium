Joy's Pov

 

After we walked around the mall, I forced her to go to Phone Shop. Luckily, She Agreed.

 

"Ano bang gagawin natin dito Joy?" She asked, while looking around the shop.

 

"I'm gonna buy you a phone ^___^" I said.

 

She's going to speak but i speak first.

 

"You signed the contraaaact" I said in a baby voice. ^3^

 

She sighed "Oo na po!" I chuckled.

"Good Afternoon Ma'am" The sales woman bowed to us.

 

"Can i see some Iphone 4s?" I said.

 

 

"Yes Ma'am, tara po dito"

 

 

She showed me all the Iphone 4s. Hmm.

 

 

"What do you like the most Alice?"

 

"Huh? Ah.."

 

 

she looked at the Iphone and pointed at the white one.

 

 

"eto oh."

 

 

"well.. I will buy this white one, how much?" i asked to the saleswoman.

 

 

She grabbed the phone.

 

 

"23,000 po.." I nodded.

 

 

The time when she leave, Alice whispered.

 

 

"Ang mahal naman niyan! Wag na yan"

 

 

"It's okey, It's for you though! My welcome gift ^___^"

 

 

"0_______0"

 

 

I paid the bills and Gave the phone to Alice.

 

 

"Wag na.. Nakaka--"

 

 

"Alice! It's my welcome gift ^___^"

 

She sighed and take the phone.

 

 

"Thanks.." She said.
